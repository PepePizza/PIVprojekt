# Mini-Project Name: Witch Ducktor
Overview of the Game: This Project was inspired by two games: ‘Animal Crossing’ and ‘Strange Horticulture’. The visual aesthetic was inspired by the cuteness observed in ‘Animal Crossing’ featuring a central character, a cute duck, navigating a cute environment. Gameplay mechanics draw inspiration from 'Strange Horticulture' emphasizing the identification and collection of plants. The plants were important to further the plot, which I had envisioned. The player wakes up on an Island and controls the character to explore their surroundings. A central objective slowly emerges: They need to find the ingredients to make an anti-duck potion, to restore the character to its original form—a witch. The genre of the game is a puzzle game.
